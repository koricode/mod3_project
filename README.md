## Samsung Galaxy Analysis

This project is part of the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization course, provided through Coursera.

The project consists on the development of a script that does a series of manipulation on the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset* in order to accomplish the goals of the peer-graded assignment.

The goals are:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The file [run_analysis.R file](run_analysis.R) contains the script and all the documentation along with the code for a better understanding of the analysis process.

The file [codebook.md file](codebook.md) contains some explanations about the variables contained in the  [measures dataset](output/measures.txt). The measures dataset is a tidy dataset fulfilling all the requirements of the assignment.
