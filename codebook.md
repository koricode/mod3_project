The tidy dataset contains 69 variables. The first three variables are:

| Variable                     | Description                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| subject                      | The subject ID                                                                                                                           |
| activity                     | The type of activity the subject was performing                                                                                          |
| group                        | The type of group the subject was part of (train or test)                                                                                |

The remaining 66 variables are all measures calculated from the original [FUCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The variable names contains a combination of words. This combination forms the meaning of the variable. The words are:

| Word                         | Description                                                                                                                              |
